# Metagenomics Tutorial

Metagenomics, or better 'omics in general can be quite complex. More and more programs are released and especially when starting with your first analysis this field can be quite overwhelming. As an attempt to make the first experience with Metagenomics easier I created this little Metagenomics Tutorial here.

As a first start you can find the [Wiki](https://github.com/mmaeke/Metagenomics_Tutorial/wiki).
